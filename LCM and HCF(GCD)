LCM: The LCM of two integers is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both.
LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)

HCF (GCD): The HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder.
We use the Euclidean Algorithm:

If b â‰  0, then
GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)

Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    static int gcd(int a,int b){
        while(b != 0){
            int temp = b;
            b = a%b;
            a = temp; //GCD calculation
        }
        return a;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int lcm = (a*b)/gcd(a,b); //LCM calculation
        System.out.println("LCM is: "+lcm+", GCD is: "+gcd(a,b));
}
}
