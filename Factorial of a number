import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        long fact = 1;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            fact *= i;
        }
        System.out.println(fact);
}
}

Sample Input: 5
Sample Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
